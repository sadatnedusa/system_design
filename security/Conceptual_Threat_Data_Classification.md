A **Conceptual Diagram** as an alternative to a **Threat Modeling Diagram** is essentially a high-level representation that shows the flow of data, interactions,
and components of a system in a way that focuses on understanding the system's architecture without necessarily delving into specific threats, vulnerabilities, or attack vectors.

This can be useful when you're looking to visualize the broader design or functional flow of a system.

### Key Points About Conceptual Diagrams:
1. **Purpose**: The primary purpose is to provide a **high-level overview** of the system, its components, and interactions, without focusing specifically on threats. This could involve:
   - Data flow between components.
   - Major system components and their relationships.
   - Communication between subsystems.

2. **Structure**: The diagram often uses **abstract representations** (like boxes or clouds) for system components and arrows to show data or process flows between them. Unlike threat modeling diagrams, which often focus on identifying attack surfaces, a conceptual diagram highlights the system’s overall structure and intended operation.

3. **Context**: It can serve as a **foundation** for further analysis, including threat modeling, by helping identify areas of interaction where risks might arise or where data flows are sensitive.

4. **Use Cases**:
   - **System design**: Clarifying architecture or components and how they interact.
   - **Communication**: Providing stakeholders a clearer understanding of the system without delving into specifics of security concerns.
   - **Identifying dependencies**: Highlighting critical components and interactions that might require more detailed security assessments.

### **Threat Modeling Diagram vs. Conceptual Diagram**:
- **Threat Modeling Diagram**: This focuses on **security threats**, vulnerabilities, and the risks associated with specific components in the system. It looks at how attackers might exploit weaknesses.
- **Conceptual Diagram**: A more generalized diagram that can provide clarity on **system components** and **data flow**. It helps in understanding the system as a whole and is usually used before drilling down into security specifics like threat modeling.

### **Data Classification** in Context of Conceptual Diagrams:

**Data classification** is the process of categorizing data based on its **level of sensitivity** and the impact that unauthorized access, disclosure, or destruction could have. It can be part of a conceptual diagram if you include data flow and highlight areas that handle sensitive data.

1. **Types of Data Classification**:
   - **Public**: Data that can be freely shared and accessed.
   - **Internal**: Data that should be kept internal to the organization, but doesn’t require extreme protection.
   - **Confidential**: Sensitive data that needs protection, like proprietary business info.
   - **Highly Confidential**: Critical data (like personal, financial, or health data) that requires the highest level of protection.

2. **How to Integrate into a Conceptual Diagram**:
   - You can color-code or label the components in your conceptual diagram according to the classification of the data they handle.
   - For example, **data flows** that involve **highly confidential** data could be marked with an icon or color, making it clear that those are areas where more stringent security measures need to be in place (e.g., encryption, access control).
   - Additionally, sensitive areas of the system (like databases) could be indicated as handling **confidential or highly confidential data**, and this helps drive discussions around where additional protection is required.

### Example:
In a conceptual diagram for a web application, you could show a data flow from a **web front-end** to a **backend server**. Next to the server, you might mark it as handling **internal** data, while a **database** might be handling **confidential** data. This kind of classification gives a visual cue for where the greatest security attention might be needed, though it’s still abstract compared to threat modeling.

### **Summary**:
- **Conceptual diagrams** are useful for providing high-level system overviews and understanding data flows but are **less focused on security threats**.
- **Data classification** can be integrated within a conceptual diagram by labeling components according to the sensitivity of the data they handle, adding another layer of context.
- These diagrams can serve as an important preliminary step for deeper security analysis, like threat modeling, by highlighting areas of interaction and flow that may need more attention later.
